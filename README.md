### DEMONSTRATIONS For Web Developers!###

This application is for rails developers and itself is based on **Rails3.2**. I deployed an instance on heroku app at [http://omnidemo.heroku.com](http://omnidemo.heroku.com). So please have a look at all tricks I ever used.

### Goal ###
Demonstrate whatever tricks or tips or techniques which were learned during web development.

### Contribute More Tricks ###
Please fork this project to contribute more demos, normally, you are suggested to demo one trick in one controller, you can create new folder for any new category of demos or just create your controller in existing folders.

After I accept your demos, I will add you as a [contributor]()!
